# N-InterferingLaserBeams

This repository contains two components
(1) A short (not quite complete) writeup on the theory used to calculate the time averaged lattice.  I provide the latex file for future edits
(2) A script to generate graphs of the time averaged intensity landscape.  There are also annotations on some of these to show the components of the interference pattern discussed in the theory document.
